# SWASHAKTI App
AI-Powered Quality Check Application for Biodegradable Sanitary Pads

---

## Overview

**SWASHAKTI** is a mobile application designed to support women-led micro-enterprises in producing safe, hygienic, and **BIS-compliant sanitary pads (IS 5405:2019)** using AI-based visual inspection.

The application enables women producers to maintain consistent quality through simple, intuitive technology without requiring technical expertise. By digitizing quality assurance, SWASHAKTI supports scalable, community-driven menstrual health solutions.

## Problem Statement

Decentralized sanitary pad production units face multiple quality and scalability challenges:

- Inconsistent quality across batches  
- Subjective and error-prone manual inspection  
- Difficulty in maintaining BIS compliance  
- Lack of accessible quality assurance tools  

These issues reduce consumer trust, increase health risks, and limit large-scale adoption.

---

## Solution

The **SWASHAKTI QC App** uses computer vision and AI to provide standardized, real-time quality inspection using a smartphone camera.

The application enables producers to:
- Scan sanitary pads visually
- Detect defects and inconsistencies
- Generate instant quality scores
- Receive corrective action guidance
- Maintain digital batch and production records
